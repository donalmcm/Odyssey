# Project Odyssey

This project is part of my final year curriculum. I am working in conjunction with Guidewire to build a mentoring tool.
 The aim of this project is to build a tool that allows employees to both become a mentor and receive mentorship.
 Scheduling functionality will be in place to set up and track the progress of the mentoring process which can be viewed by both participants and managers.
